The economic model that we base our approach upon is Wassily Leontief's Input-Output model, which was first proposed in 1951 and which has become a common tool for economists to understand economic networks (see Carvalho and Tahbaz-Salehi (2018) [1], for instance). At its core, the model is based on the idea that sectors in an economy are interconnected through input-output linkages. In other words, part of what one sector produces is used as an input by other sectors. The building block of the Input-Output model is the so-called Leontief's Inverse Matrix. To see how Leontief's inverse matrix is relevant, note that the $(i; j)$ element of the Leontief inverse, $l_{ij}$, measures the importance of industry $j$ as a direct and indirect input-supplier to industry $i$ in the economy. Furthermore, $l_{ij}$ accounts for all possible directed walks (of various lengths) that connect industry $j$ to industry $i$ over the network.\n","\n","In what follows, we construct the Leontief inverse matrix using the worldwide IO tables provided by the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/sti/ind/inter-country-input-output-tables.htm) [2]. We use the data for the last year available, 2015, published in 2018. The process to build this matrix based on the raw data consists of these steps: \n","- First, we take the matrix of trade flows between sectors (the raw table that we get from the OECD), which we call Z, and aggregate all non-essential sectors. \n","- Second, we construct the column vector x, which represents the total production by sector. \n","- Third, we combine x and Z to get matrix A, which gives us the coefficients IO table. The difference between A and Z is that Z represents trade flows, whereas A represents the input linkages in terms of relative proportions (assuming a Cobb-Douglas production function). \n","- Finally, we construct the Leontief inverse L from A. The Leontief inverse is defined as $L = (I-A)^{-1}$.\n","\n","We will use a package called `pymrio` to ingest and process the input-output tables. You can read the docs [here](https://pymrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n","\n","To know more about these matrices, their meaning, the Leontief model and how it is used in general, this [paper](http://vasco-m-carvalho.github.io/pdfs/ProductionNetworks.pdf) by Carvalho and Tahbaz-Salehi (2018) is a good reference. The notation for A and L is the same. Z is referred to as trade flows matrix. x is not explicitly mentioned.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["**Table of contents**  \n","* [Input-output flows matrix Z](#Z)\n","* [Final demands vector x](#x)\n","* [Coefficients matrix A](#A)\n","* [Leontief's inverse matrix L](#L)\n","\n","**Inputs**\n","- OECD's Input-Output tables [1]\n","\n","**Outputs** \n","- All matrices relevant to Leontief's Input-Output model"]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","source":["# Imports and path\n","import warnings\n","try:\n","    import pymrio\n","except:\n","    warnings.warn('Pymrio missing')\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import networkx as nx\n","import seaborn as sbs\n","import random\n","\n","\n","%matplotlib inline\n","oecd_storage = Path('/project_data/data_asset')"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"/opt/conda/envs/Python-3.6-WMLCE/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ipykernel/__main__.py:6: UserWarning: Pymrio missing\n","name":"stderr"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","source":["# Select the year to parse - 2015 in this case\n","oecd_path_year = pymrio.parse_oecd(path=oecd_storage, year=2015)"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<a id='Z'></a>\n","### Input-Output flows matrix Z\n","Firs, we read the input-output tables and format them to get the matrix representing the direct relations between the sectors.
