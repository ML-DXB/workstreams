# Geiospatial Knowledge

This folder contains a jupyter notebook that computes
* a world-continent-country-states graph of the world,
* neighbourhood relationships for countries and states using various geospatial data files, and
* a showcase for multiprocessing in a jupyter notebook without using ipyparallel
